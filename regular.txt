there once was a young person named little red riding hood who lived on the edge
 of a large forest full of endangered owls and rare plants that would probably
 provide a cure for cancer if only someone took the time to study them

red riding hood lived with a nurture giver whom she sometimes referred to
 as mother although she didnt mean to imply by this term that she would
 have thought less of the person if a close biological link did not in fact exist

nor did she intend to denigrate the equal value of nontraditional households
 although she was sorry if this was the impression conveyed

one day her mother asked her to take a basket of organically grown fruit
 and mineral water to her grandmothers house

but mother wont this be stealing work from the unionized people who have
 struggled for years to earn the right to carry all packages between various
 people in the woods

red riding hoods mother assured her that she had called the union boss
 and gotten a special compassionate mission exemption form

but mother arent you oppressing me by ordering me to do this

red riding hoods mother pointed out that it was impossible for women to
 oppress each other since all women were equally oppressed until all 
women were free

but mother then shouldnt you have my brother carry the basket since 
hes an oppressor and should learn what its like to be oppressed

and red riding hoods mother explained that her brother was attending a 
special rally for animal rights and besides this wasnt stereotypical 
womens work but an empowering deed that would help engender a feeling 
of community

but wont i be oppressing grandma by implying that shes sick and hence 
unable to independently further her own selfhood

but red riding hoods mother explained that her grandmother wasnt actually 
sick or incapacitated or mentally handicapped in any way although that was 
not to imply that any of these conditions were inferior to what some people 
called health

thus red riding hood felt that she could get behind the idea of delivering
 the basket to her grandmother and so she set off

many people believed that the forest was a foreboding and dangerous place but
 red riding hood knew that this was an irrational fear based on cultural
 paradigms instilled by a patriarchal society that regarded the natural
 world as an exploitable resource and hence believed that natural predators
 were in fact intolerable competitors

other people avoided the woods for fear of thieves and deviants but red riding
 hood felt that in a truly classless society all marginalized peoples would
 be able to come out of the woods and be accepted as valid lifestyle role
 models

on her way to grandmas house red riding hood passed a woodchopper and
 wandered off the path in order to examine some flowers

she was startled to find herself standing before a wolf who asked her
 what was in her basket

red riding hoods teacher had warned her never to talk to strangers but
 she was confident in taking control of her own budding sexuality and
 chose to dialogue with the wolf

she replied i am taking my grandmother some healthful snacks in a
 gesture of solidarity

the wolf said you know my dear it isnt safe for a little girl to
 walk through these woods alone

red riding hood said i find your sexist remark offensive in the extreme but
 i will ignore it because of your traditional status as an outcast from
 society the stress of which has caused you to develop an alternative and
 yet entirely valid worldview now if youll excuse me i would prefer
 to be on my way

red riding hood returned to the main path and proceeded towards her grandmothers
 house

but because his status outside society had freed him from slavish adherence to
 linear westernstyle thought the wolf knew of a quicker route to grandmas house

he burst into the house and ate grandma a course of action affirmative of
 his nature as a predator

then unhampered by rigid traditionalist gender role notions he put on grandmas
 nightclothes crawled under the bedclothes and awaited developments

red riding hood entered the cottage and said grandma i have brought you some
 cruelty free snacks to salute you in your role of wise and nurturing matriarch

the wolf said softly come closer child so that i might see you

red riding hood said goddess grandma what big eyes you have

you forget that i am optically challenged

and grandma what an enormous what a fine nose you have

naturally i could have had it fixed to help my acting career but i didnt
 give in to such societal pressures my child

and grandma what very big sharp teeth you have

the wolf could not take any more of these specist slurs and in a reaction
 appropriate for his accustomed milieu he leaped out of bed grabbed little
 red riding hood and opened his jaws so wide that she could see her poor
 grandmother cowering in his belly

arent you forgetting something red riding hood bravely shouted you must
 request my permission before proceeding to a new level of intimacy

the wolf was so startled by this statement that he loosened his grasp on her

at the same time the woodchopper burst into the cottage brandishing an ax

hands off cried the woodchopper

and what do you think youre doing cried little red riding hood if i let
 you help me now i would be expressing a lack of confidence in my own
 abilities which would lead to poor self esteem and lower achievement scores
 on college entrance exams

last chance sister get your hands off that endangered species this is an
 fbi sting screamed the woodchopper and when little red riding hood nonetheless
 made a sudden motion he sliced off her head

thank goodness you got here in time said the wolf the brat and her grandmother
 lured me in here i thought i was a goner

no i think im the real victim here said the woodchopper ive been dealing with
 my anger ever since i saw her picking those protected flowers earlier and now im
 going to have such a trauma do you have any aspirin

sure said the wolf

thanks

i feel your pain said the wolf and he patted the woodchopper on his firm well
 padded back gave a little belch and said do you have any maalox
